This is an E-commerce Java Web Application


This is an e-commerce Java web
application for a small retail store where the store owner sells his/her products
online. The application allows the owner to manage products, customers, and
orders. Also, with the application customers make orders and pay for the ordered
products. The application uses PayPal Express Checkout as its payment solution.
In addition, the web store offers customers and visitors to the site an opportunity
to subscribe to an email list in order to get news about new products and special
offers. Lastly, the application sends an automatic email confirmation after
completing an order or subscribing to an email list.


The database communication of the application was
implemented by using JPA and JPQL, and MySQL database was used to store the
application data. The application was structured according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. 
The model, the view and the controller layers were
implemented by using JavaBeans, JSPs, and Servlet API respectively. The
payment transaction of the application was carried out on PayPal Sandbox (testing
environment) with different NVP API operations.
